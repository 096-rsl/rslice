	<p>Lendino was founded in early 2014 with a vision to make it easier and faster to borrow while creating an attractive lending opportunity for investors. Lendino is a marketplace for loans where individuals and professionals can lend directly to small Danish companies. Companies apply quickly and easily under transparent conditions. Lenders provide financing against an attractive interest rate. We are 100% online, without a branch network and using technology to save money, which we pass on in the form of attractive interest rates for both lenders and borrowers.

Since 2018 we have been promoting our IT solution under the brand Smallbrooks. The Smallbrooks system makes it fast, easy and affordable for everyone to get their own crowdfunding platform. The solution is extremely flexible and therefore particularly well suited for organisations that already have a "crowd" (of members, customers, residents etc.), a context, and IT systems that the solution needs to adapt to.</p>
