	<p>Over $1,000 was raised during Mount Prospect’s annual Family Bike Ride Saturday at Melas Park, by community members behind Lemonade For Lendino’s, a fundraising effort started to help a grieving Mount Prospect family.

Alyssa Lendino, 16, was killed in a car crash July 21 when, according to Wheeling police, 30-year-old Adam Grunin of Wheeling was traveling 107 mph and rear ended the Lendinos’ vehicle at Milwaukee Avenue and Hintz Road. He was charged with reckless homicide.

Since the beginning of August, when family friend Julie Bohannon and 25-30 other community members started selling cups of lemonade to help with the family’s finances, along with setting up a GoFundMe page seeking donations, over $67,000 has been raised. Donations can also be sent to Signature Bank on Devon Avenue in Chicago in the family name.

The first weekend (Aug. 4-5), lemonade was sold at 13 different locations in Mount Prospect, along with one in Wheeling and another in Palatine. 

The group will host two more lemonade stands to raise additional funds on Saturday, Aug. 25. The first one will be held from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at Grace Lutheran Church, 1624 E. Euclid Ave., Mount Prospect, during a carwash for the non-profit Indian Princesses organization. The second will be held on the same day from 12:30 to 4 p.m. at Friedrichs Funeral Home, 320 Central Rd., Mount Prospect.

“We are all close family friends and we have all spent a lot of time together and the community as a whole was devastated…everyone wanted to do something to help the family,” Bohannon said. “It has been a group effort and people pitching in and we would have never been able to do all of this without all of them helping.”

Bohannon said when they first started the lemonade stands, she initially thought maybe $500 would be raised, but nothing like what has been accumulated so far.

She said the family has yet to see any bills related to the tragic event, but expects those expenses to be extremely high once they come in. She said immediate family members and close friends are providing the family with meals three times a week in addition to helping the family run errands and other daily chores.

According to Bohannon, during all of the fundraising efforts, a common theme from the community has been people sharing their stories of tragedy, or how they survived a horrible accident, and wanting to give back in some way.

She said they will continue to host lemonade stands as long as possible and will keep the GoFundMe page active as long as donations keep coming in.
