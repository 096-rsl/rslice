	<p>Introduction
Lendino is one of the first crowdfunding platforms for company loans in the Nordics. On lendino.dk companies can get loans that are funded by our crowd of private and professional investors. After almost five years in operation, we have now reached a point where this part of our business is steadily growing and expected to generate a profit from the second half of 2019. This stability allows us to shift focus to another part of our business, where new opportunities have arisen.

Since our launch in 2014, several organisations have asked us if we could create a crowdfunding platform for them, and in 2017 we created Coop Crowdfunding for Coop, Denmarkâ€™s largest retailer with 1.7 million members. By having a crowdfunding platform, Coop can help small food producers get funding while at the same time giving their members access to exciting new food products that cannot be found in stores. This is great PR for Coop - and the data obtained is very useful when deciding which food products to add to their selection.

This inspired us to create a general IT solution that makes it fast, easy and affordable for others to start their own tailor-made crowdfunding platform while re-using the core functionality of the Lendino system. We are now promoting the IT solution under its own brand, Smallbrooks, and we spent the second half of 2018 researching the market, building a strong pipeline of potential customers and even signing contracts with two new clients (a university and a bank) in Denmark.

There is a large and growing global market for creating crowdfunding platforms for others. We are seeking capital in order to address this market by promoting Smallbrooks and expanding into other countries.
